            <h2>Privacy notice</h2>
            <p>
              In order to provide you with the best service possible I need to
              hold your personal contact details and records of your therapy
              sessions. This privacy notice tells you what I will do with your
              personal information from initial point of contact through to
              after therapy has ended. Your privacy is very important to me and
              you can be confident that your personal information will be kept
              safe and secure and will only be used for the purpose it was given
              to me. I adhere to current data protection legislation, including
              the General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (the GDPR),
              the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic
              Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. I also adhere to
              the ethical guidelines regarding protecting client privacy and
              confidentiality set by the British Association for Counselling and
              Psychotherapy (BACP).
            </p>
            <h2>
              My lawful basis for holding and using your personal information
            </h2>
            <p>
              The GDPR states that I must have a lawful basis for processing
              your personal data. There are different lawful bases depending on
              the stage at which I am processing your data. If you have had
              therapy with me and it has now ended, I will use legitimate
              interest as my lawful basis for holding and using your personal
              information. If you are currently having therapy or if you are in
              contact with me to consider therapy, I will process your personal
              data where it is necessary for the performance of our contract.
              The GDPR also makes sure that I look after any sensitive personal
              information that you may disclose to me appropriately. This type
              of information is called ‘special category personal information’.
              The lawful basis for me processing any special categories of
              personal information is that it is for provision of health
              treatment (in this case therapy sessions) and necessary for a
              contract with a health professional (in this case, a contract
              between me and you).
            </p>
            <h2>How I use your information</h2>
            <p>
              I will never use your personal data for any purposes other than
              the administration of the therapy service that I am providing to
              you i.e. to arrange, cancel and rearrange appointments. I will
              only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary.
              This is in line with guidance from the Information Commissioner’s
              Office.
            </p>
            <h3>Initial contact:</h3>
            <p>
              When you contact me to book your first appointment I will collect
              some brief information to help me to process your enquiry. This
              will include your name so that I can book the appointment into my
              diary and also a contact method, for example an email address or
              phone number. This information is requested so that you could be
              informed if I was unable to attend an appointment due to
              unforeseen circumstances. If you do not want to be contacted under
              any circumstances you do not need to provide a contact method.
              Alternatively, an organisation such as your employer may send me
              your details when making a referral or a relative may give me your
              details when making an enquiry on your behalf. If an enquiry is
              made and you decide not to proceed I will ensure that all of your
              personal data is deleted within one month. If you would like me to
              delete this information sooner please let me know.
            </p>
            <h3>While you are accessing therapy:</h3>
            <p>
              Your email address or phone number will be used to provide you
              with written confirmation of your appointment times if you have
              given consent for this. Your email address and telephone number
              will only be used to contact you regarding appointment times
              unless we have agreed that I will also use your email address to
              email you information that is relevant to your therapy sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning of your first appointment I will ask you to
              complete a personal details form containing your name, address,
              date of birth, contact information and also contact information
              for your GP. The form is stored in a ################. Please be
              aware that I will not routinely contact your GP to inform your GP
              of your attendance as your attendance is confidential. To fulfil
              my duty of care towards you while also maintaining your
              confidentiality I will only contact your GP if it is necessary and
              should these circumstances arise I would discuss this with you
              wherever possible before contacting your GP.

              Rest assured that what is said in our sessions will be kept
              confidential. I am an Accredited Member of the British Association
              of Counselling & Psychotherapy (BACP) and I abide by their
              professional code of ethics. Confidentiality will only be broken
              if there are legal or ethical obligations to disclose, for
              example, if you disclose abuse/neglect of a child or vulnerable
              adult, or say something else that implies serious harm to yourself
              or others, or if a court of law requires me to disclose
              information. In the event that confidentiality must be broken I
              will always try to speak to you about this first, unless there are
              safeguarding issues that prevent this.

              Counsellors are required to have regular supervision support so I
              may discuss our work with my supervisor. This would be done
              without identifying you and my supervisor is a counsellor who also
              abides by the BACP’s code of ethics regarding confidentiality.

              I keep brief notes of our therapy sessions for the purpose of
              assisting our work together. The notes help me to keep track of
              the issues that we are working on and they are for my use only.
              The notes do not include any personal details that could be used
              to identify you and they are stored ##########. Your therapy notes
              are stored separately to your personal details form.
            </p>
            <h3>After therapy has ended:</h3>
            <p>
              There are reasons why counsellors are required to keep records
              after therapy has ended. For example, in the case of financial
              transactions personal information must be retained for as long as
              legally required in respect of tax or accounting purposes.
              Retaining your therapy notes ensures that I can continue to offer
              you an efficient service if you make contact after therapy has
              ended. Your therapy notes do not include any personal details that
              could be used to identify you and continue to be stored securely
              in a ####################### for seven years after therapy has
              ended. This time frame adheres with current industry guidelines.
              Seven years after therapy has ended your therapy notes will be
              confidentially destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your personal details form is confidentially destroyed on ending
              your therapy sessions. Please note that I need to keep a record of
              your name, date of birth and your client reference number for
              seven years after therapy ends. Your client reference number
              corresponds with a client reference number on your therapy notes
              and therefore enables me to identify your therapy notes if
              necessary.

            <h2>Third party recipients of personal data</h2>
            <p>
              I share a limited amount of personal data with third parties in
              order to provide therapy services to you, for example if you
              contact me to book an appointment I will give your name to
              reception at the location where your appointment is due to take
              place (if applicable), in order to book your appointment at that
              location. If your appointments are paid for or arranged via a
              third party, for example, your employer, the only information
              shared with the third party is your dates of attendance and
              non-attendance for invoicing and payment purposes. Details about
              what is discussed in your appointments will remain confidential
              and can only be shared if you give me your written consent to do
              so.
            </p>
            <h2>Data security</h2>
            <p>
              I take the security of the data that I hold about you very
              seriously. My email account is password protected and mobile
              phones and laptops used to respond to your emails are password
              protected. Any email correspondence will be deleted within one
              month if it is not necessary to keep it. If it is necessary to
              retain the information I will print the email and store it
              securely ############ that only I have access to.
